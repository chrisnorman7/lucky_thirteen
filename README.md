# Lucky Thirteen

An arcade-style number game.

## Description

In Lucky Thirteen, you are presented with a 5 by 5 board of tiles. Each tile has a stack of 13 randomly generated numbers on it. Your job is to move around the board, finding combinations of two or more numbers to make thirteen until there are no more stacks left.

Each time you get it right, the numbers you selected vanish from the board. Each time you get it wrong however, another random number is added onto every tile you selected.

## Game play

You can move with the arrow keys: Up is forward, down is backwards, and left and right do what you'd expect. If you come up against the edge of the board, you will hear a sound.

To select a tile, press the enter key. If you wish to know how many numbers remain in a stack, press the d key.

To deselect all the times you have previously selected, press the escape key.

If you wish to see a menu containing all the possible keyboard shortcuts, press shift and slash (/), as if you were typing a question mark. Please note that this menu is not self voicing like the rest of the game.

## Empty tiles

When you have cleared a stack of tiles, those tiles can still be of use. Towards the end of the game, you will probably find yourself in a situation where half the board is empty, and the other half is full of elevens and twelves. There are two things you can do about this:

Firstly, if you select a single tile with numbers still on it, then select an empty tile straight afterwards, the top number of the first tile will be randomised, thus increasing your chances of getting a good number.

Secondly, you can select two or more numbers adding up to less than 13, then select an empty tile to finish off the set.

## Winning the game

While there is no real way to lose the game - other than to make more work for yourself - you can definitely win. Simply clear all the tiles, and you'll get some lovely music, and be placed back at the start, ready to play again.

## Quitting the game

Hard as it is to believe, it is possible that you will want to exit Lucky Thirteen to get on with your normal life. You can do this by pressing alt and f4.

# Credits

Massive thanks go to Brandon Cross for making most of the sound fx used in the game. Without him, the sound quality would simply be terrible, rather than gloriously retro.

The music for the game was obtained from [here](https://www.fesliyanstudios.com), so thanks to the creators of that music, because it's brilliant!
